## Future Enhancements
We are excited about the potential of summAIze and have several features planned to make it even more efficient and user-friendly:

### 1. Integration with Additional Email Providers

While summAIze currently supports Gmail and Outlook, future updates will include support for other major email providers such as Yahoo Mail and ProtonMail. This will enable a broader range of users to connect their preferred email accounts seamlessly.

### 2. Advanced Task Parsing

We plan to improve the AI's ability to process complex or vague input text, providing more detailed and actionable task breakdowns. For example, parsing multi-step instructions or extracting deadlines automatically from input text.

### 3. Automated Task Addition to Calendar

In future iterations, we also plan to automate task addition to calendar, so once a task is created and confirmed by the user, the task will be automically added to the user's calendar.

### 4. Recurring Tasks and Events

Users will soon be able to create recurring tasks or calendar events. This includes options to set daily, weekly, monthly, or custom recurrence intervals, helping users manage repetitive tasks effortlessly.


### 5. Priority Levels for Tasks

Introducing priority tags like High, Medium, and Low for tasks, allowing users to organize and focus on the most critical activities. Sorting tasks by priority in the Task Box and Calendar will also be enabled.
